# My Learning Journey in Code

Welcome to my personal code repository! This repository serves as a living archive of the code, projects, and exercises I've completed throughout my academic journey. It's a way for me to track my progress, revisit concepts, and showcase the skills I've developed over time.

## üèõÔ∏è Repository Structure

This repository is organized by academic semester. All the code, notes, and projects for a specific semester are contained within their own dedicated **branch**.

This structure keeps the `main` branch clean and makes it easy to navigate to the work from a particular period of my studies.

### Branches
* `semester-1`
* `semester-2`
* `semester-3`
* `...and so on`
